        <h1>Node Foreman</h1>

<p>Node Foreman is a Node.js version of the popular 
<a href="http://ddollar.github.com/foreman/">Foreman</a> tool,
with a few Node specific changes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Foreman is a manager for Procfile-based applications. 
Its aim is to abstract away the details of the Procfile 
format, and allow you to either run your application 
directly or export it to some other process management format.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>Install the command line tool</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install -g foreman
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Node Foreman can be run with as little as <code>nf start</code>, as long as <code>npm start</code> has been defined.
For more complicated applications you will want to define a <code>Procfile</code> for your various server
processes and and a <code>.env</code> file to preload environmental variables.</p>

<p>Your module directory should end up looking like the following:</p>

<pre><code>/
├─ .env
├─ package.js
├─ server.js # or whatever you call your application
├─ Procfile
</code></pre>

<p>Once your Procfile is defined, run your application with <code>nf start</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ nf start

18:51:12: web.1     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5000
18:51:13: api.1     |  Api Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5100
18:51:13: log.1     |  Log Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5200
</code></pre>

<p>Node Foreman <em>always</em> start in the foreground and expects your applications
to do the same. If your processes exit, Node Foreman will assume an error
has ocurred and shut your application down.</p>

<p>Instead of daemonizing, you should use <code>nf export</code> to ready your application
for production.</p>

<h3>Procfile</h3>

<p>The <code>Procfile</code> format is a simple <code>key : command</code> format:</p>

<pre><code>web: node web_server.js
api: node api_server.js
log: node log_server.js
</code></pre>

<p>Each line should contain a separate process.</p>

<h3>Environmental Variables</h3>

<p>Create a <code>.env</code> file to pre-load environmental variables with the format:</p>

<pre><code>MYSQL_NAME=superman
MYSQL_PASS=cryptonite
</code></pre>

<p>The equivalent <code>.env</code> file may alternatively be a valid JSON document:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "mysql":{
        "name": "superman",
        "pass": "cryptonite"
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above JSON document will be flattened into env variables by 
concatenating the nested values with an underscore.
Environmental variables are passed in fully capitalized.</p>

<pre><code>{
    "mysql":{
        "name": "superman",     # =&gt; MYSQL_NAME=superman
        "pass": "cryptonite"    # =&gt; MYSQL_PASS=cryptonite
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is no need to specify which type of file you wish to use.</p>

<h4>Best Practices</h4>

<p>Generally you should not check your <code>.env</code> file into version control.
The <code>.env</code> file contain <em>only</em> parameters that depend on where the application
gets deployed. It should not contain anything related to <em>how</em> the application
is deployed.</p>

<p>For example, good candiates for the <code>.env</code> file are MySQL connection information,
port bindings, and other passwords.</p>

<p>Bad candidates are default configurations that do not contain any location-specific
information.</p>

<h3>Advanced Usage</h3>

<p>Node Foreman lets you start multiple jobs of the same type:</p>

<pre><code>$ nf start web=5

18:51:12: web.1     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5000
18:51:12: web.2     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5001
18:51:12: web.3     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5002
18:51:12: web.4     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5003
18:51:12: web.5     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5004
</code></pre>

<p>Each job will be started as its own process, receiving a different <code>PORT</code>
environmental variable. 
The port number for processes of the same type will be offset by 1.
The port number for processes of different types will be offset by 100.</p>

<pre><code>$ nf start web=2,api=2

18:51:12: web.1     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5000
18:51:12: web.2     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5001
18:51:12: api.1     |  Api Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5100
18:51:12: api.2     |  Api Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5101
</code></pre>

<h2>Export to Production</h2>

<p>Node Foreman is designed to be in a development environment,
however it can export an Upstart job for use in production.
The Upstart file has <em>no</em> dependency on Node Foreman.</p>

<pre><code>$ nf export
Loaded ENV .env File as JSON Format
Wrote  :  ./foreman-web-1.conf
Wrote  :  ./foreman-web.conf
Wrote  :  ./foreman-api-1.conf
Wrote  :  ./foreman-api.conf
Wrote  :  ./foreman-log-1.conf
Wrote  :  ./foreman-log.conf
Wrote  :  ./foreman.conf
</code></pre>

<p>You can inspect your upstart files before placing them in the right
directory, or have foreman do it for you:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo nf export -o /etc/init
Loaded ENV .env File as JSON Format
Wrote  :  /etc/init/foreman-api-1.conf
Wrote  :  /etc/init/foreman-web.conf
Wrote  :  /etc/init/foreman-api.conf
Wrote  :  /etc/init/foreman-log.conf
Wrote  :  /etc/init/foreman-log-1.conf
Wrote  :  /etc/init/foreman-web-1.conf
Wrote  :  /etc/init/foreman.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Start and stop your jobs with</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo start JOBNAME
$ sudo stop JOBNAME
</code></pre>

<p>The export will occur with whatever environmental variables are 
listed in the .env file.</p>

<p>You can specify the type and number of processes exported using 
the <code>type=num</code> syntax:</p>

<pre><code>$ nf export -a JOBNAME -o /etc/init web=2,api=2
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>-u &lt;USER&gt;</code> to have the exported job run as <code>USER</code>.
Note that if you need to bind to privileged ports, you <em>must</em>
start as <code>root</code>. In such a case, we advise you to drop user
permissions after binding.</p>

<h2>Scalability</h2>

<p>Node.js applications scale by creating multiple processes that either 
share a socket, or sit behind a load balancer.
Node Foreman can help you test the parallel capabilities of your application
by spawning multiple processes behind a round-robin proxy automatically.</p>

<pre><code>$ nf start -x 8888 web=5
[OKAY] Starting Proxy Server 8888 -&gt; 5000-5004
</code></pre>

<p>Access your application from port <code>8888</code> and the connections will be balanced
across the servers started from ports <code>5000</code> - <code>5004</code>.</p>

<p>If your application gets its port number from <code>process.env.PORT</code> the proxy
setup will ocurr automatically.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Node Foreman disallows applications from starting on privileged ports.
It does however allow proxies to be bound to lower ports, such as port 80.</p>

<p>If you require access to a privileged port, start Node Foreman with <code>sudo</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo nf start -x 80 web=5
[OKAY] Starting Proxy Server 80 -&gt; 5000-5004
</code></pre>

<p>Your application will then be accessible via port 80.</p>

<p>Your applications will <em>still</em> be started in user space, and the proxy will
drop its privileges after binding to the privileged port.</p>
